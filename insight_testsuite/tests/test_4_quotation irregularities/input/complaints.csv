2019-07-05,Debt collection,Other debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive notice of right to dispute,"I worked for XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX directly paid XXXX for my internet service at my resident. I never received any billing statement from XXXX. Everything was handled directly between XXXX and XXXX. 
I moved and ended my employment with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I received a letter from XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX to my new address attempting to collect {$120.00} for XXXX. I called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to resolve issue and they confirmed the account was XXXX corporate account. I also called XXXX XXXX to dispute my collection account. I finally received a letter from XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX that they had reviewed account and resolved it. The letter stated "" Our office has reviewed the above-referenced account and we have made the decision to discontinue our collection efforts. Rest assured that no information regarding this account has been reported to the credit bureaus by this agency. '' I thought this issue was resolved and closed. 

However, recently, I checked my credit reports on XX/XX/XXXX and I noticed a collection account is on my file. It damaged my credit score and my credit history. I have disputed with all 3 credit agencies. XXXX and XXXX did not resolve my issue. I requested XXXX  3 times : 1 in XXXX, 1 in XXXX, and 1 in XXXX to send me my dispute result in writing but I still haven't received any in mail. XXXX sent me the investigation results. The letter stated that the Collection account from XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX. I never receive any letter or any notification from XXXX XXXX XXXX before. This is the first time I am aware of the collection account from XXXX XXXX XXXX for the same creditor XXXX is on my credit file. How many collection agencies out there attempting to collect the same account for XXXX? How can I dispute when I never receive any mail or notification from XXXX XXXX XXXX.? 
Please assist me to resolve this issue and make sure the collection account is removed from my credit file.",Company believes the complaint is the result of a misunderstanding,"CCS Financial Services, Inc.",TX,,,Consent provided,Web,2019-07-05,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3296949
